      <h2>The story</h2>

      <p id="1p">
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
        evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
        <q class="neighbors">
          We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
          unfortunate.
        </q>
        The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q
        >. The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and said,
        <q class="neighbors">
          Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
          horses!
        </q>
        The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q
        >. The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
        riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
        <q class="neighbors"
          >Oh dear, that’s too <span class="B"> bad </span> ,</q
        >
        and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q
        >. The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
        people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken
        leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
        <q class="neighbors">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,
        <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q
        >. The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
        complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
        happens in it is <span class="G"> good </span> or
        <span class="B"> bad </span> because you never know what will be the
        consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
        consequences of <span class="G"> good </span> fortune. Alan Watts

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="G"> good </span> and <span class="B"> bad </span> are just
        one perspective. Bananas are <span class="G"> good </span> for monkeys,
        but monkeys are not <span class="G"> good </span> for bananas. Let's not
        make a big deal out of it...
